            Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to Marquette, Michigan. He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and after some healthy meals and a trip to the vet he is doing great!

            My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large house since we were previously living in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run around, but when he is sleepy he is happy to be held.

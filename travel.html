                            Palo Alto is a city located in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Palo Alto was established in 1894 when Leland Stanford founded Stanford University. It is named after a costal redwood tree called El Palo Alto. It is home to many tech companies and startups, as well as Stanford University.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Palo Alto has two main commercial areas, University Ave and California Ave, both of which have delicious restaurants and stores. Many people come to Palo Alto to see Stanford, but there’s so much more to do. Palo Alto is home to many nature preserves such as Foothills Park and the Baylands, which are popular for hiking, walking, biking, and other outdoor activities.

                            Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas.  In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world’s active geysers.

                        <p>
                            These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.  You  can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots, Tourons of Yellowstone, or  Cowboy State Daily.
